<h2 id="whyhomeopathy" class="faq-question">Why homeopathy?</h3>
<p>Homeopathy is one of the most individualized systems of medicine: for each client, we recommend 1 of over 5000 remedies that matches them – as a whole person – best. It is more than freedom from symptoms: it is towards freedom to be your full self.</p>

<h2 id="remedies" class="faq-question">What are homeopathic remedies?</h2>
<p>Remedies are very small amounts of plants, animals and minerals. The remedies that we use are <em>potentized</em>, meaning that the substance used is diluted in water and succussed (the bottle is struck on a hard surface) to transform it into an energetic form.</p> <br />

<p>It's more physics than chemistry: the frequency, or memory of the substance acts on the person by touching their <em>qi</em>, or what we call the Vital Force (your life energy), revealing the mistunement and showing it the best path to healing. Thus our remedies are very safe, and side effects are rare. Remedies come in pellet or liquid form.</p>

<h2 id="othertreatments" class="faq-question">Does homeopathy work with medications or other treatments?</h2>
<p>Because our remedies act on an energetic level, they are complementary to other medications and treatments. We encourage clients to see allopathic (conventional medical) doctors, surgeons, and hospitals - they often do amazing work. We respect their areas of strength, and would love to see ours brought into partnership.</p>

<h2 id="whathomeopathytreats" class="faq-question">What does homeopathy treat?</h2>
<p>Homeopathy does not treat symptoms; it strengthens the person. Homeopathic remedies are like gentle touches of consciousness, informing your system on the best way to heal. Thus homeopathy works with all forms of dis-ease.</p>

<h2 id="pregnancy" class="faq-question">Can homeopathy help me if I'm pregnant and/or breastfeeding?</h2>
<p>Absolutely. Homeopathy can be very helpful for all phases of pregnancy, and for reproductive health in general.</p>

<h2 id="results" class="faq-question">When will I see results?</h2>
<p>This depends on the individual, their chief complaint, their lifestyle and their vitality. Healing often begins in the first consultation, where they are asked to express their full selves, free of judgment. As a practitioner, I look for substantial progress on the chief complaint by the second follow-up (8-12 weeks after initial consultation).</p>

<h2 id="frequency" class="faq-question">How long do I need to see a homeopath?</h2>
<p>As stated above, our goal is much deeper than the elimination of symptoms. We understand healing as ongoing, a lifelong process. Homeopathy, by strengthening the whole person, is about reducing susceptibility to future dis-ease. So, we recommend that you see a homeopath regularly for the long term, varying in frequency according to life events.</p>

<h2 id="sideeffects" class="faq-question">Are there harmful side effects to a homeopathic remedy?</h2>
<p>Because homeopathic remedies are such small doses (highly diluted) of the substance, they have minimal side effects. Without explicit abuse (i.e., taking repeated daily doses for a month without recommendation from a homeopath), side effects are extremely rare.
