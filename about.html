<p class="alt-text">Homeopathy was first created as a German system of healing using plants, animals and minerals to re-tune and strengthen one's innate healing power – what we call a vital force. </p>

<p>With a strengthened Vital Force, a client can not only experience the improvement of specific symptoms, but also become generally less susceptible to disease.</p>

<p>Homeopathy doesn’t focus on quick fixes. We use over 5,000 remedies, and there is only one that matches the client best.</p>

<section class="alt-container">
<p>For this reason, homeopaths need up to 2 hours in an initial consultation, to truly understand what is unique about the client. We see homeopathy as a process, and do not simply pound symptoms down by force, like many pharmaceuticals do. </p>

<p><img rel="divider" src="img/about-img4.jpg" /></p>

<p>Instead, we use symptoms like the engine warning lights of a car: they inform us on the inner state of disease. Sessions can feel similar to therapy, and are a part of healing.</p>
