<h2>About the Homeopath</h2>
<p class="about"><strong>David Kim</strong> (he/they) is a homeopath who locates his roots in the Pacific, Uchinawa, Korea, and Scotland. Love, belief and chimu (the heart) ground his practice. He is drawn—by genealogy and by training—to the intersections of Indigenous language revitalization, Land, history and medicine. David is completing training at the Northwestern Academy of Homeopathy.
