<p class="alt-about">Homeopathy was first created as a German system of healing using plants, animals and minerals to re-tune and strengthen one's innate healing power – what we call a vital force. </p>
<hr>

<img class="group" src="img/about-img2.jpg" />
<p>With a strengthened Vital Force, a client can not only experience the improvement of specific symptoms, but also become generally less susceptible to disease.</p>
<hr>

<img class="groupb" src="img/about-img3.jpg" /><p>Homeopathy doesn’t focus on quick fixes. We use over 5,000 remedies, and there is only one that matches the client best.   </p>
<hr>

<p class="alt-about">For this reason, homeopaths need up to 2 hours in an initial consultation, to truly understand what is unique about the client. We see homeopathy as a process, and do not simply pound symptoms down by force, like many pharmaceuticals do. </p>
<img class="center" src="img/about-img4.jpg" />
<p class="alt-about">Instead, we use symptoms like the engine warning lights of a car: they inform us on the inner state of disease. Sessions can feel similar to therapy, and are a part of healing.</p>
